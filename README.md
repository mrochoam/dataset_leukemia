# dataset_leukemia
Bone marrow leukemia smear images. 
The dataset leukemia images are .png images of 320 Ã— 256 dimension. Observation of the smears was done with a Luzeren XSZ-148S optical microscope under a 1250X magnification. The configuration to obtain this magnification consists of: -  WF 10X/18mm eyepiece,   -  100X infinite planachromatic objective (requires immersion oil),  -  numerical aperture AN = 1.25, -  objective operating distance 0.15 - 0.2 mm. 
Image digitization was performed with a 1.3-megapixel digital camera integrated into the microscope using the image management software included with the camera, and a USB interface. The illumination source was 6V/20W.
